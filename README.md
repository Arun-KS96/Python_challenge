## Exercise 5

Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

- Under 18.5 they are underweight
- Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
- Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
- Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
- Above 35 they are clinically obese.

## Exercise 6

Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year:
- on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
- **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
- **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

## Exercise 8

You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

To work out the love score between two people:

Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

- For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be: "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."

- For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be: "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."

- Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.: "Your score is **z**."
