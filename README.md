## Exercise 5

Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

- Under 18.5 they are underweight
- Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
- Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
- Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
- Above 35 they are clinically obese.

## Exercise 6

Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year:
- on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
- **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
- **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400
