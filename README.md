## Exercise 5

Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

- Under 18.5 they are underweight
- Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
- Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
- Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
- Above 35 they are clinically obese.

## Exercise 6

Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year:
- on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
- **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
- **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

## Exercise 7

Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza. Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program.

Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.

- Small Pizza: $15
- Small Pizza: $15
- Medium Pizza: $20
- Medium Pizza: $20
- Large Pizza: $25
- Large Pizza: $25
- Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2
- Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2
- Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3
- Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3
- Extra cheese for any size pizza: + $1

## Exercise 8

You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

To work out the love score between two people:

Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

- For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be: "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."

- For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be: "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."

- Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.: "Your score is **z**."

## Exercise 10

You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.
**Important**: *You are not allowed to use the choice() function.*

## Exercise 12

Write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

**Important:** You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using for loops.

## Exercise 13

Write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

**Important:** You are not allowed to use the max or min functions.

## Exercise 14

Write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:
i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

**Important:** There should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

## Exercise 15

Write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
- Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
- When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
- When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz". 
- When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz". 
- And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"
